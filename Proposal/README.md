## Project Proposal

## Description of the Project
This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to uncover patterns and trends. We strive to understand how factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and location affect Uber ride demand and pricing. This analysis will help predict ride demand, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall operational efficiency for ride-sharing services.

## Clear Goal(s)
- **Predict Ride Demand**: Successfully predict the number of Uber rides based on time of day, weather conditions, and location.
- **Optimize Pricing**: Identify key factors influencing Uber ride pricing and develop a model to optimize pricing strategies.
- **Operational Insights**: Provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency, such as optimal driver allocation and peak demand times.

## Data Collection
- **Data Source**: We will use publicly available Uber ride datasets from sources like Kaggle, Uber's open data portal, and other relevant data repositories.
- **Data Collection Method**:
  - **Historical Ride Data**: Download historical ride information, including timestamps, pickup and drop-off locations, ride duration, and fare amounts.
  - **Weather Data**: Collect weather data corresponding to the ride timestamps from APIs like OpenWeatherMap or Weather.com.
  - **Geospatial Data**: Use geospatial data to map ride locations to specific neighborhoods or regions.

## Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values in the datasets by imputing them or removing incomplete records.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Ensure no duplicate records exist in the datasets.
- **Data Consistency**: Standardize data formats, such as date and time formats, to ensure consistency across the datasets.

## Feature Extraction
The goal of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to uncover patterns
  - **Clustering**: Use clustering algorithms like K-means to group similar rides based on features such as location and time.
  - **Linear Regression**: Fit a linear regression model to predict ride demand based on time and weather conditions.
  - **Decision Trees and Random Forest**: Use decision trees and Random Forest models to predict ride pricing based on multiple features.
  - **XGBoost**: Implement XGBoost to improve ride demand and pricing prediction accuracy.
  - **Deep Learning**: Explore deep learning methods like neural networks for complex pattern recognition and prediction tasks.

## Data Visualization
- **Visualization Techniques**:
  - **Bar Plots**: Create bar plots to show the distribution of rides across different times of the day, days of the week, and locations.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between ride demand pricing and other features.
  - **Interactive t-SNE Plots**: Implement interactive t-SNE plots to visualize high-dimensional data and identify clusters.
  - **Heatmaps**: Generate heatmaps to show ride density and demand across different regions.
  - **Strip Plots**: Use strip plots to show the distribution of categorical data, such as ride types and payment methods.

## Test Plan
- **Data Split**: Withholding 20% of the data for testing to evaluate model performance.
- **Training and Testing**: Train models on data collected in November and test on data collected in December to ensure temporal consistency.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance. Use R-squared and feature importance scores to assess model accuracy and interpretability.

## Group Information
- **Group Size**: 2 Students
- **Student 1**: Ritesh Rana
- **Student 2**: Sai Yasasvi Dutt Malladi

## Notes
The project's goals are clearly defined at this stage, and the data collection methods are outlined. The modeling and visualization aspects will evolve as we learn more techniques in class and see what the data looks like.
