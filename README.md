# Uber-Ride-Demand-and-Pricing-Analysis

# Project Proposal

## Description of the Project
The goal of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to uncover patterns and trends. We aim to understand how various factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and location affect Uber ride demand and pricing. This analysis will help in predicting ride demand, optimizing pricing strategies, and improving overall operational efficiency for ride-sharing services.

## Clear Goal(s)
- **Predict Ride Demand**: Successfully predict the number of Uber rides based on factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and location.
- **Optimize Pricing**: Identify key factors that influence Uber ride pricing and develop a model to optimize pricing strategies.
- **Operational Insights**: Provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency, such as optimal driver allocation and peak demand times.

## Data Collection
- **Data Source**: We will use publicly available Uber ride datasets from sources like Kaggle, Uber's open data portal, and other relevant data repositories.
- **Data Collection Method**:
  - **Historical Ride Data**: Download datasets containing historical ride information, including timestamps, pickup and drop-off locations, ride duration, and fare amounts.
  - **Weather Data**: Collect weather data corresponding to the ride timestamps from APIs like OpenWeatherMap or Weather.com.
  - **Geospatial Data**: Use geospatial data to map ride locations to specific neighborhoods or regions.

## Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values in the datasets by either imputing them or removing incomplete records.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Ensure there are no duplicate records in the datasets.
- **Data Consistency**: Standardize data formats, such as date and time formats, to ensure consistency across the datasets.

## Feature Extraction
- **Time-based Features**: Extract features such as hour of the day, day of the week, and month from the ride timestamps.
- **Weather Features**: Include weather-related features like temperature, precipitation, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
- **Geospatial Features**: Extract features related to pickup and drop-off locations, such as neighborhood, distance traveled, and ride duration.

## Data Modeling
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - **Clustering**: Use clustering algorithms like K-means to group similar rides based on features such as location and time.
  - **Linear Regression**: Fit a linear regression model to predict ride demand based on time and weather conditions.
  - **Decision Trees and Random Forest**: Use decision trees and Random Forest models to predict ride pricing based on multiple features.
  - **XGBoost**: Implement XGBoost to improve prediction accuracy for both ride demand and pricing.
  - **Deep Learning**: Explore deep learning methods like neural networks for complex pattern recognition and prediction tasks.

## Data Visualization
- **Visualization Techniques**:
  - **Bar Plots**: Create bar plots to show the distribution of rides across different times of the day, days of the week, and locations.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between ride demand and pricing, as well as other features.
  - **Interactive t-SNE Plots**: Implement interactive t-SNE plots to visualize high-dimensional data and identify clusters.
  - **Heatmaps**: Generate heatmaps to show ride density and demand across different regions.
  - **Strip Plots**: Use strip plots to show the distribution of categorical data, such as ride types and payment methods.

## Test Plan
- **Data Split**: Withhold 20% of the data for testing to evaluate model performance.
- **Training and Testing**: Train models on data collected in November and test on data collected in December to ensure temporal consistency.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance. Additionally, use R-squared and feature importance scores to assess model accuracy and interpretability.

## Group Information
- **Group Size**: 2 Students
- **Student 1**: Ritesh Rana
- **Student 2**: Sai Yash 

## Notes
At this stage, the goals of the project are clearly defined, and the data collection methods are outlined. The modeling and visualization aspects will evolve as we learn more methods in class and see what the data looks like.
