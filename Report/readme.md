## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis contains data on 693,071 Uber rides, with 57 columns detailing information such as:
- **Ride details**: price, distance, cab type, source, destination.
- **Geolocation**: latitude, longitude.
- **Time and Date**: timestamp, hour, day, month.
- **Weather**: temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility.

## Installation
To replicate this analysis, clone the repository and ensure the following dependencies are installed:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels plotly folium

Place the dataset (`rideshare_kaggle.csv.zip`) in the root directory.

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration
   - **Basic Info**: Loaded the dataset, inspected its shape, columns, and data types.
   - **Missing Values**: Found missing values in the `price` column, which were later imputed using median values by hour and distance.
   - **Data Preview**: Displayed initial rows to confirm data integrity.

### 2. Univariate Analysis
   - **Distribution of Price and Distance**: Histogram plots for `price` and `distance` revealed their frequency distributions.
   - **Outlier Detection for Price**: Detected outliers using Z-score, removing 5,114 rows with extreme price values.

### 3. Bivariate Analysis
   - **Price vs Distance**: Scatterplot visualized the relationship, showing a positive correlation.
   - **Day of Week vs Price**: Analyzed price variations across different days (if applicable).
   - **Hourly Price Patterns**: Analyzed price across times of day (e.g., morning, afternoon).

### 4. Multivariate Analysis
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Computed correlations among numerical features, visualized in a heatmap to identify highly correlated attributes.
   - **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Tested for multicollinearity among features like distance and fare per mile.

### 5. Outlier Detection
   - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Z-score**: Used these methods to identify and handle outliers in price and distance.

### 6. Clustering Analysis
   - **KMeans Clustering**: Clustered rides into 3 categories based on price and distance.

### 7. Geospatial Analysis
   - **Mapping Ride Locations**: Created an interactive map of ride locations using `folium` to identify popular areas.
   - **Price vs Distance by Cab Type**: Used `plotly` to show relationships between price, distance, and cab type.

## Findings

- **Pricing Trends**: Rides with greater distances typically cost more, showing a clear positive correlation between distance and price.
- **Outliers**: Significant price outliers were detected and removed; clustering reveals distinct groups in terms of price and distance.
- **Geolocation Insights**: Mapping rides indicates popular pickup/drop-off locations.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Pricing fluctuates based on time of day and day of the week.

## Visualizations

1. **Price Distribution** - Shows the frequency of different prices.
2. **Distance Distribution** - Displays the frequency of different ride distances.
3. **Price vs Distance** - Scatterplot indicating the relationship.
4. **Boxplots** - Visualize price variation across time/day.
5. **Heatmap** - Correlation heatmap of numerical features.
6. **Clustering Analysis** - Visualization of clusters in price and distance.
7. **Map** - Interactive map marking each rideâ€™s geolocation.

## Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features based on timestamps (e.g., rush hours, weekends).
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Implement regression models to predict ride prices.
- **Enhanced Outlier Detection**: Try alternative outlier detection methods.
- **Customer Insights**: Segment rides based on cab type and user behavior.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into Uber rideshare data, highlighting price determinants and identifying patterns across geolocation and time. The findings could help in demand prediction and price optimization.
